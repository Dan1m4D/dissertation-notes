Design Thinking is a human-centered, non-linear, and iterative design framework that allows us as designers to understand users’ needs while creating innovative solutions to address them. By structuring the creative process into distinct stages – empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test – we gain not only a toolkit but also a mindset that enables innovation to happen. I see it as a map: it does not offer us a single path, but it guides us through turbulence, laying down the conditions for ideas to emerge and grow.

Personally, I believe that the importance of having a framework like this lies in its ability to foster creativity while mitigating risks and chaos. Creativity alone is indeed powerful yet unstructured, and by default easy to get lost in. Design Thinking balances freedom with direction, ensuring that new ideas can emerge while still being refined. In short, using this framework allows me to approach new projects with confidence, as I can focus on user needs while still exploring innovative solutions. In the medium to long run, I am positive that this will strengthen my abilities in collaboration and problem solving.

However, not all challenges can or should be approached with pragmatic and immediate solutions. **Speculative Design** is a practice that uses design to imagine future possibilities. By creating hypothetical scenarios, products, and services, Speculative Design provokes reflection about what kind of futures we desire to pursue and which ones we should avoid. It pushes us beyond a problem-solving mindset into a more speculative and critically imaginative one, encouraging us to question rather than just design.

I am particularly fond of **Design Fiction**, where fictional narratives are used to deepen speculation. With Design Fiction, we can explore more abstract futures and truly challenge ourselves to think more creatively about the social, cultural, and ethical consequences of design. A strong example is _CopenHill_ in Denmark, a design solution that began as a fictional idea and eventually found both place and function in the real world. I value this approach because it reminds us that design is not just about function or efficiency, but also about shaping how we might live, interact, and evolve as a society.

For me, the most valuable lesson from this class is the realization that both Design Thinking and Speculative Design complement each other in the path of design. While Design Thinking helps us structure and organize creativity to avoid chaos, Speculative Design provokes us to expand our imagination and shape future visions. By employing both of these frameworks, I can focus my creativity on meeting user needs while keeping an open mind to alternative possibilities. I firmly believe that by balancing these two approaches I will be able to solve today’s problems while inspiring tomorrow’s solutions.

## Image Prompt:  
*“A conceptual illustration of a map growing from an human head: multiple paths branching from the start and going into multiple directions, representing creativity and design thinking. Some paths are clear and others are foggy. Further above the paths, clouds reveal countless abstract and surreal visions of possible futures — imaginative cities, floating objects, and dreamlike landscapes barely visible on the horizon. The style should be minimalistic yet artistic, blending clarity of a map with the mystery of speculative design. Soft lighting, slightly surreal atmosphere.”*
