One of the ideas that resonated with me from this class was the notion that a brand is not something we create entirely as designers, but something dynamic and alive that exists in people’s minds. As Marty Neumeier defines it, a brand is “a person’s gut feeling about a product, service, or organization.” This concept shifts branding from something purely visual or strategic that we create to something inherently social and emotional that people feel and understand. Therefore, we can say that a brand is a shared perception — a “thing” that is built collectively by the people who interact with it, experience it, and find meaning in it.

I find this extremely fascinating because it reminds me that branding is less about control and more about connection. It’s as if we, as designers, have the power to shape how a brand communicates, looks, and behaves, but the real brand lies in how people perceive it and relate to it. The fascinating part is that different people will perceive the brand differently, as that perception comes from their interactions with it, their familiarity, and their sense of identification. Over time, these perceptions form a kind of collective memory, where people not only recognize a brand — they _feel_ something about it. Take Coca-Cola, for example. While we identify the iconic typography and colors, we are even more likely to feel a sense of happiness or nostalgia. Coca-Cola never branded itself as “the best beverage,” but instead associated its product with joyful moments that evoke emotion. As consumers, we linked those moments to the brand, generating this collective memory that “Coca-Cola tastes like happy moments.”

This emotional connection is what allows a brand to generate identification. When we see our values, aspirations, or personality reflected in a brand, we immediately begin to associate ourselves with it. This identification creates loyalty and engagement, and often, without realizing it, we start advocating for the brand. Returning to Coca-Cola, the brand doesn’t limit itself to selling a drink — it sells a philosophy that happy moments should be lived and shared, ideally with a Coca-Cola in hand. By doing so, it aligns itself with the consumer’s values.

Personally, I believe that understanding a brand as a shared perception changes how I approach design and branding as a whole. It opened my mind to think beyond visuals and to consider how every element of the experience — emotion, interaction, storytelling, and identification — contributes to the collective perception. In the end, I feel that approaching branding from this viewpoint will help me create brands that feel more human, authentic, and identifiable — brands that people not only recognize, but relate to.

"A conceptual illustration showing a brand as a shared perception: a glowing symbol or shape at the center, surrounded by people connected through threads of light, each reflecting their interpretation of that symbol. The style should be clean, minimalistic, and slightly surreal, symbolizing how collective perception gives form to a brand."One of the ideas that resonated with me from this class was the notion that a brand is not something we create entirely as designers, but something dynamic and alive that exists in people’s minds.
