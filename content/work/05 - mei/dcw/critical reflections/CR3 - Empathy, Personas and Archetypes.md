As I’ve mentioned in previous reflections, the Design Thinking process relies on empathy to fuel our understanding of users, ultimately allowing us to create insights about them. It is what allows us to perceive users not as abstract points of data but as real human beings with emotions, struggles, motivations, and limitations. However, when we try to transmit these insights within a team, it often proves to be difficult. This is where tools like personas and archetypes become essential: they translate abstract insights into relatable and structured representations of users.

A persona is a model that embodies the behaviors, goals, struggles, limitations, and desires of a selected user segment. It is created based on observations of real user data and later synthesized into a fictional yet realistic profile that accurately represents that user segment’s genuine needs. This characteristic of putting a face and name to a previous set of data is where personas really shine. I think that alone helps us remember who we are designing solutions for, and why they matter. At the same time, they allow us to better empathize with that set of users, ensuring that every decision made in the design process is based on user needs.

Alongside personas, archetypes add yet another layer of understanding about our users. Based on patterns such as Carl Jung’s archetypes or the user archetypes proposed by Youngblood and Chesluk, they help unveil universal motivations that may be overlooked when focusing only on individual profiles. While personas are more concrete and data-driven, archetypes are broader and more symbolic. They reveal recurring patterns of behavior, goals, and fears that transcend specific contexts. For instance, recognizing whether a user approaches technology as an “Explorer,” a “Caregiver,” or a “Perfectionist” can guide us in anticipating how they might interact with a product or service.

Personally, I find that combining personas and archetypes is really powerful, as they manage to structure the insights that emerge from the first design phases. They act like shaping a cloud of insights into human form, allowing us to navigate the complexity of user diversity while keeping our focus on the user’s goals. They allow me, as a designer, to use insights as tools to address problems in a more user-centric way and to better communicate that understanding to others.

Ultimately, I see personas and archetypes as the bridge between empathy and design action. They prevent us from designing based solely on assumptions or stereotypes, reminding us that every user has context and individuality. By integrating these tools into my process, I can ensure that my design decisions are not only informed by data but also guided by genuine human understanding.

## AI Image Prompt:  
"A conceptual illustration showing a cloud of empathy transforming into personas and archetypes: from a cloud of abstract emotions and observations, silhouettes of persons take form and gain a face. Upon them a type emerges like a label. The style should be clean, minimalistic, and slightly surreal, symbolizing the bridge between emotion and structure in design."
