## Design Thinking
![[Pasted image 20250924093538.png]]
Design thinking is like agile for designers - It's cyclical and allows us as designers to have a framework to work

In a project is better to have a mix of people - people who are good to follow orders and those who are good at questioning the steps; and those who can see value in the market as well as those who can create that said value.

**Design thinking** differs from agile because it is **human centered**. It's a framework that allows designers to foster innovations while reducing the risks associated.
